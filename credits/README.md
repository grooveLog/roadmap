# Thanking those who have supported / advised / conributed

GrooveLog is starting out as a bootstrapped side project, and hence any help is welcome. This is a page to recognise people who have spared some of their precious time / intellect / emotions into offering feedback, advice, or contributions... If the project grows into something big I would like to show my gratitude in more useful ways (e.g hard cash / or a proper involvement), but in the meantime I'll just keep track of people's input so that I don't forget - John Durrant, November 2018..
